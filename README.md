##  Data Source
- **European Values Study (EVS) 2017 â€“ Italy**
- Sample size: 2,277 respondents  
- Variables: life satisfaction, antisocial behavior index, gender, education, and political orientation  

---

##  Methodology
The analysis includes:
- **Bivariate regression** between life satisfaction and antisocial behavior  
- **Trivariate analysis** with gender as a control variable  
- **Multivariate regression** including education and political orientation  

The antisocial behavior index was normalized and built from four indicators, with **Cronbachâ€™s alpha > 0.7**, indicating satisfactory internal reliability.

## Main Findings
- Higher **life satisfaction** is associated with **lower justification** of antisocial behaviors.  
- **Higher education** decreases the tendency to justify antisocial actions.  
- **Political orientation** (right-leaning) slightly increases justification levels.  
- **Gender differences** are not statistically significant.
